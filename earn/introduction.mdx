description: Earn yield on prediction market outcome tokens while maintaining full exposure to your positions

## The Problem

Major prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket offer 3-4% annual interest on open positions through banking yield. This is significant for traders as they earn passive income simply by holding positions, essential for predictions with longer resolution timeframes (e.g., US Presidential Elections).

**Tokenized prediction markets lack this capability.** When you hold YES or NO outcome tokens on-chain, they sit idle in your wallet earning zero yield!

Cleopetra Earn fixes this by bringing yield-generating capability to tokenized prediction markets, enabling you to earn yield on your outcome tokens while maintaining full exposure to your predictions.

## How It Works

In any binary prediction market, **1 YES token + 1 NO token always equals $1 in value.** This mathematical certainty enables us to safely match opposing tokens of the same market and generate yield from the stablecoin backing.

Here's the flow:

1. **Deposit**: Multiple traders stake their YES or NO tokens
2. **Match**: We match opposite tokens of the same market (YES + NO pairs)
3. **Redeem**: Matched pairs are redeemed for stablecoins (USDC/USDT)
4. **Lend**: Stablecoins are deposited into money markets (Jupiter Lend and Kamino)
5. **Earn**: Yield accumulates and auto-compounds
6. **Withdraw**: Claim your yield + outcome tokens anytime, before or after market resolution

<Check>
Matching engine only lends fully hedged/matched tokens so withdrawals never affect solvency while ensuring full exposure to prediction.
</Check>

## Deposits

When you deposit YES or NO tokens, Cleopetra's matching engine automatically pairs your tokens with the opposite one of the same market. For example:

- Your 100 YES tokens + another trader's 100 NO tokens = 100 matched pairs
- These 100 pairs are redeemed for $100 in stablecoins
- The stablecoins are immediately deposited into money markets to start earning yield

If matching isn't immediately available, your tokens will be queued and matched as opposite positions become available.

## Yield Earning

Yield is generated by lending and auto-compounding the stablecoin backing (USDC/USDT) via established Solana money markets including:

- Jupiter Lend
- Kamino

Yield rates vary based on market conditions and lending rates, typically ranging from 4-10% APY depending on the underlying money market rates.

<Warning>
Yield is distributed proportionally based on your share of the staking pool and time staked. **Unmatched tokens don't earn yield until they're paired.**
</Warning>

## Withdrawals

You can withdraw your staked tokens at any time before or after market resolution, along with the yield earned.

During volatile markets, pools can become unbalanced when one side dominates (e.g., many YES deposits but few NO deposits). Unmatched tokens remain available for instant withdrawal without yield. The protocol continuously matches positions as opposite tokens become available.

## Integration Benefit

Trading terminals can integrate Cleopetra Earn to auto-stake every newly created position or allow users to voluntarily stake their outcome tokens to earn yield.

With numerous vertical trading terminals launching powered by DFlow and Kalshi's tokenized infra, yield capabilities are critical:

- **Whale and large-quantity traders**: Yield-earning functionality is non-negotiable for long-term positions
- **Competitive necessity**: Without yield, traders lose the 3-4% annual interest available on centralized platforms
- **User retention**: Make your platform competitive by providing users with a higher 4-10% yearly yield powered by stablecoin lending

We support both TypeScript SDK and REST API for flexible integration. Developer documentation is coming soon. Reach out to our team to get early access.
