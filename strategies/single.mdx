With Cleopetra's single-sided strategy, you can provide liquidity for just one token in the pool, unlike traditional strategy where you deposit equal values of both tokens.

This approach gives you some advantages:

- **No need to split capital** — you can stay fully exposed to the token you believe in.
- **Reduces volatility risk** — by avoiding price divergence between two assets.

Here's how it works, the risks involved, and some things you should know before trading.

<Info> Auto-Rebalancing is only supported in spot strategy and does NOT work for single-sided positions. </Info>

## How The Strategy Works

When you create a single-sided LP position with Cleopetra, here's what happens:

1. You select a token (like BONK, FARTCOIN, or JLP) from the trending list or entering token CA in bot chat

2. You choose the "Single-sided" strategy option

3. Cleopetra agent automatically:

   - Finds the best pool with the highest fees
   - Lets you select which token you want to supply
   - Swaps your provided SOL amount into selected token if necessary
   - Asks you to choose the price range you want to cover (10%, 25%, 50%, or custom)
   - Sets up a concentrated position (with price range dependig on the % selected and token supplied)

4. All tokens in position and LP fees are swapped back to SOL when you close this position

## What Makes This Strategy Special?

- **Customizable Price Range:** Choose how much price movement your position should cover.

- **Single Token Supply:** Reduced volatility risk since you're only supplying one token.

- **Concentrated Liquidity:** By focusing on a specific price range, you can earn more fees with the same amount of tokens.

<Note>

Remember: Cleopetra makes LPing easier, it doesn't eliminate the risks. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
