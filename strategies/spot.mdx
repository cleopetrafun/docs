With Cleopetra’s spot strategy, you provide liquidity by depositing equal value of both tokens in the pool.

This approach gives you some advantages:

- **Earn fees on both sides** — you capture trading fees from both tokens in the pair.
- **Stable exposure** — ideal if you’re neutral on both assets or believe in the pair long-term.

Here's how it works, the risks involved, and some things you should know before trading.

## How The Strategy Works

When you create a spot LP position with Cleopetra, here's what happens:

1. You select a token (like BONK, FARTCOIN, or JLP) from the trending list or entering token CA in bot chat

2. You choose the "Spot" strategy option

3. Cleopetra agent automatically:

   - Finds the best pool with the highest fees
   - Swaps 50% of your provided SOL amount into base tokens (like BONK or JLP) and rest 50% into quote tokens (like USDC or SOL) if necessary, to create a balanced position
   - Sets up a concentrated position (20 price bins on each side)
   - Monitors and rebalances your position every hour (if you enable this)
   - Compounds earned fees back into your position during rebalancing

4. All tokens in position and LP fees are swapped back to SOL when you close this position

## What Makes This Strategy Special?

- **Concentrated Liquidity:** Instead of spreading your tokens across all prices, we focus on a range where trading is most likely to happen. This means you can earn more fees with the same amount of tokens.

- **Auto-rebalancing:** If you enable it, Cleopetra monitors your position continuously based on chosen schedule and rebalances if needed. This helps maintain optimal earning potential.

- **Fee Compounding:** Any LP fees you earn is automatically compounded back into your position, helping your investment grow over time.

<Note>

Remember: Cleopetra makes LPing easier, it doesn't eliminate the risks. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
