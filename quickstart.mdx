### Setting Up Your Wallet

Open the [Cleopetra bot](https://t.me/cleopetra_bot?start=ref_GOLD) and run `/start` to get started. You may need to enter an invite code to join the platform.

Next, deposit SOL into your wallet by copying the address. Make sure to deposit at least `0.07 SOL` for gas fees and any additional amount required to create LP positions.
