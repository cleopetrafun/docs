### Setting Up Your Wallet

Open the [Cleopetra bot](https://t.me/cleopetra_bot) and run `/start` to get started. You may need to enter an invite code to join the platform.  

Next, deposit funds into your wallet by copying the address. Make sure to deposit at least `0.07 SOL` for gas fees and any additional tokens required to create LP positions.

### Creating LP Positions

Click the `Open Position` button under the token details to create a new LP position. You will then be prompted to confirm the LP strategy and auto-rebalancing settings.  
Currently, Cleopetra supports the Spot LP strategy. Learn more about it [here](/strategies/spot).

Preview your LP position creation details, and once you're ready, click `Yes` to create the position.
